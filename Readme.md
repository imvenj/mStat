# mStat

A mini system status widget for macOS.

## Download

You can download mStat app from [release page](https://github.com/imvenj/mStat/releases). 

App is code signed and notarized. :)

## Why open source?

Because this app is rejected multiple times because it is TOO simple. But I still found it is useful to make it open source and share the [ready-to-use Mac App](https://github.com/imvenj/mStat/releases) with you guys who likes the simpleness of this app, instead of using the full-blown commercial system monitor apps.
